# 🌍 Global Happiness Report 2019 - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the 2019 Global Happiness Report. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights behind how various socio-economic and emotional factors influence the happiness scores of 156 countries.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the structure and distribution of happiness-related features
- Compare the top 10 happiest and bottom 10 least happy countries
- Explore relationships between GDP, health, social support, freedom, generosity, and corruption
- Identify the most influential features affecting the happiness score

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

### 🔹 Feature-Centric Analysis
- Distribution & skewness of each feature
- Identification of countries with extreme values (e.g., high GDP, low corruption)

### 🔹 Comparative Analysis
- Feature-to-feature relationships using scatterplots and correlation heatmaps
- Regression line plots (e.g., GDP vs Health, Generosity vs Social Support)

### 🔹 Target-Centric Analysis
- Correlation of each feature with the Happiness Score
- Top vs Bottom 10 country comparison via heatmaps

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **GDP**, **Social Support**, and **Healthy Life Expectancy** are the strongest positive contributors to happiness
- **Generosity** and **Perceptions of Corruption** are weakly correlated with overall happiness
